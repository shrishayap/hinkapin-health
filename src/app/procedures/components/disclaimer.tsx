                                Note: Cash prices apply to patients who pay the entire fee in advance, and will likely not count toward an insurance deductible. If you choose to have a claim filed, either for private insurance or government insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.), the quoted cash rate does not apply to you. The cash prices offered are possible because advance payment eliminates 1) the expense of processing claims and 2) the risk of non-payment of fees.Â Prices include applicable facility, physician, and anesthesia fees. Additional fees may be charged for complication or comorbidity.
