                        A 3.5% fee will be added to all card payments for our bundled flat-rate surgery program. This fee applies to patients who pay for their procedures themselves, without using insurance. If you choose to pay with a card, the additional 3.5% fee will be added to your final payment amount.
                        For example, if your total bill is $100, you would pay $103.50 if using a credit or debit card. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your understanding and continued patronage.

                        This fee applies to all credit card transactions, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. The fee is non-refundable. We are unable to waive the fee.
